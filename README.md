Bayesian Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation (BIRDiE) is a
Bayesian model for accurately estimating conditional distributions by
race, using Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) probability
estimates of individual race. This package implements BIRDiE as
described in [McCartan, Fisher, Goldin, Ho and Imai (2022)](#).
Replication materials for that paper may be found in `replication/`.
