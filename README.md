Bayesian Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation (BIRDiE) is a
Bayesian model for accurately estimating conditional distributions by
race, using Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) probability
estimates of individual race. This package implements BIRDiE as
described in McCartan, Fisher, Goldin, Ho and Imai (2022) \<arXiv:\>.
