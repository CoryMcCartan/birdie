Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) is a simple model that predicts
individual race based off last names and addresses.  While predictive, it
is not perfect, and measurement error in these predictions can cause problems
in downstream analyses.

Bayesian Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation (BIRDiE) is a class of
Bayesian models for accurately estimating conditional distributions by race, 
using BISG probabilities as inputs. 
This package implements BIRDiE as described in [McCartan, Fisher, Goldin, Ho, and Imai (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2025.2526695).
It also implements standard BISG and an improved measurement-error BISG model as described 
in [Imai, Olivella, and Rosenman (2022)](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adc9824).

## Installation

You can install the latest version of the package from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("birdie")
```

You can also install the development version with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CoryMcCartan/birdie")
```

## Basic Usage

A basic analysis has two steps.
First, you compute BISG probability estimates with the `bisg()` or `bisg_me()` functions (or using any other probabilistic race prediction tool).
Then, you estimate the distribution of an outcome variable by race using the `birdie()` function.

```{r}
library(birdie)

data(pseudo_vf)

head(pseudo_vf)
```

To compute BISG probabilities, you provide the last name and (optionally) geography variables as part of a formula.

```{r}
r_probs = bisg(~ nm(last_name) + zip(zip), data=pseudo_vf)

head(r_probs)
```

Computing regression estimates requires specifying a model structure.
Here, we'll use a Categorical-Dirichlet regression model that lets the
relationship between turnout and race vary by ZIP code.
This is the "no-pooling" model from McCartan et al.
We'll use Gibbs sampling for inference, which will also let us capture the uncertainty in our estimates.

```{r}
fit = birdie(r_probs, turnout ~ proc_zip(zip), data=pseudo_vf, 
             family=cat_dir(), algorithm="gibbs")

print(fit)
```

The `proc_zip()` function fills in missing ZIP codes, among other things.
We can extract the estimated conditional distributions with `coef()`.
We can also get updated BISG probabilities that additionally condition on turnout using `fitted()`.
Additional functions allow us to extract a tidy version of our estimates (`tidy()`)
and visualize the estimated distributions (`plot()`).

```{r}
coef(fit)

head(fitted(fit))

tidy(fit)

plot(fit)
```
