Bayesian Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation (BIRDiE) is a Bayesian
model for accurately estimating conditional distributions by race, using
Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) probability estimates of individual
race.
This package implements BIRDiE as described in [McCartan, Fisher, Goldin, Ho and Imai (2022)](#).
Replication materials for that paper may be found in `replication/`.
